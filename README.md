## Project 4

This project worked primarily with Node.js web server JavaScript code. This project worked with REST API server and fastify.
The project had us working with an array of data objects which were were then asked to create different GET routes for the server in order to get different information from the questions. Some GET routes required using request parameters while others didn't. As extra credit we also completed POST PUT and DELETE routes for the data.
